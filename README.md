## Marching Squares visualisation using C++ and raylib.

Interpolation is weird and raylib lines are ugly. I don't know how to make it nice.

Default configuration will visualize the algorith going through a set of points generated with OpenSimplex noise. After each set it will automatically generate a new set and start again.


Maybe I'll include marching cubes in this at some point.
