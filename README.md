## Marching Squares visualisation using C++ and raylib.

Interpolation is weird and raylib lines are ugly. I don't know how to make it nice.

Default configuration will visualize the algorith going through a set of points generated with OpenSimplex noise. After each set it will automatically generate a new set and start again.


I won't do marching cubes :(
I wanted to, but I can't be bothered to do all the 3D work to actually render all the stuff needed properly with raylib.
